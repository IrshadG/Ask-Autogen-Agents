       "'Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference Chi Wang1Susan Xueqing Liu2Ahmed H. Awadallah1 Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked significant interest in their generative capabili- ties, leading to the development of various com- mercial applications. The high cost of using the models drives application builders to max- imize the value of generation under a limited inference budget. This paper presents a study of optimizing inference hyperparameters such as the number of responses, temperature and max tokens, which significantly affects the util- ity/cost of text generation. We design a framework named EcoOptiGen which leverages economi- cal hyperparameter optimization and cost-based pruning. Experiments with the GPT-3.5/GPT-4 models on a variety of tasks verify its effective- ness. EcoOptiGen is implemented in the ‘auto- gen’ package of the FLAML library: https: //aka.ms/autogen . 1. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT- 4 (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of generative tasks, including story telling (Lucy and Bamman, 2021; Chen, 2022), code generation (Trummer, 2022; Poe- sia et al., 2022), math problem solving (Cobbe et al., 2021; Zong and Krishnamachari, 2022), and many others (Wang et al., 2022). Even though the LLMs do not always gener- ate perfect answers, they have initiated a trend of building powerful user experiences such as coding assistants and chat-enabled search engines. As the interest of building LLM-enabled applications keeps growing, the demand for technologies for getting the best value out of generation inference will also grow. The research community has recently studied the effect of individual hyperparameters on the inference performance, 1Microsoft Research2Stevens Institute of Techology.

Copyright 2023 by the author(s).such as the prompt (Liu et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2021; Shieh, 2022) and temperature (Branwen, 2020; Nadeem et al., 2020). However, little is known about how to op- timize the different hyperparameters collectively and sys- tematically. Moreover, the monetary cost is a concern for most application builders. High costs and implications on energy consumption and environmental impact (Schwartz et al., 2020) provide a strong incentive to systematically optimize the hyperparameters towards maximal utility and minimal cost. In this paper, we present the first study on the systematic hyperparameter optimization for text generation inference using LLMs. Given the cost concern, we adopt an economi- cal hyperparameter optimization method (Wang et al., 2021), and propose a cost-based pruning strategy to improve the optimization efficiency under budget constraints. We apply our optimization framework, named EcoOptiGen , to tune multiple hyperparameters jointly, including the number of responses, max tokens, temperature, probability mass, and prompts. To study the effectiveness of EcoOptiGen, we evaluate it on the following datasets: APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) (for code gener- ation); MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) (for math problem solving); and XSum (Narayan et al., 2018) (for text summa- rization). On all the four datasets, we observe that EcoOpti- Gen can find higher quality hyperparameter settings than the default settings suggested by a recent LLM benchmark HELM (Liang et al., 2022) or simple modifications for the same budget. Our pruning technique is shown to be effec- tive in increasing the tuning performance significantly. We further find that the holistic hyperparameter optimization can mitigate idiosyncrasies to prevent suboptimal results. 2. Background 2.1. Text Generation with LLMs The Input and Output of LLM Text Generation Fig- ure 1 shows one example of the input prompt to LLM. Upon receiving the prompt, LLM performs inference to generate one or more output responses. The input prompt can further include multiple examples to demonstrate whatarXiv:2303.04673v2  [cs.CL]  8 Aug 2023Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference Figure 1. A code generation example using GPT-4, and a few examples of hyperparameters users can set for the inference, such as prompt, temperature, and max tokens. kind of responses are desirable. The output can be con- sumed or validated by an application in various ways, e.g., code executor (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) or math expression checker (Hendrycks et al., 2021b). It is often helpful for the inference to generate multiple responses and search for the best one, e.g., in code generation (Chen et al., 2021) and ma- chine translation (Wullach and Chazan, 2022). The utility of the generated text is determined by the application consum- ing it. For example, when a predefined programmatic test is provided before generation, the code generation can be considered as successful if one of the generated responses can pass the test. The Cost of Text Generation with LLMs The cost of using LLMs for a text generation request is proportional to the amount of computations required to generate the output. The amount of computations is determined by the number of tokens in both the input and output. LLMs are often used as a service and charged based on the usage. From the perspective of an application builder using LLMs, the goal is to maximize the utility of the generated text under an inference budget constraint (e.g., measured by the average dollar cost needed to solve a coding problem). This can be achieved by optimizing the hyperparameters of the inference, which can significantly affect both the utility and the cost of the generated text. In the next section, we will discuss how hyperparameters affect the utility and the cost. 2.2. How Do Hyperparameters Affect Text Generation Performance? The Impact of Individual Hyperparameters We take a representative API from OpenAI, i.e., the completions API (ope, 2023), to analyze the tunable hyperparameters and their impact on the cost and the utility (e.g., accuracy, success rate): (1) model - this is a required input, specifyingthe model ID to use. (2) prompt - the input prompt to the model, which provides the context for the text generation task. (3) max tokens - the maximum number of tokens (words or word pieces) to generate in the output. (4) temper- ature - a value between 0 and 1 that controls the randomness of the generated text. A higher temperature will result in more random and diverse text, while a lower temperature will result in more predictable text. (5) top p - a value be- tween 0 and 1 that controls the sampling probability mass for each token generation. A lower top p value will make it more likely to generate text based on the most likely tokens, while a higher value will allow the model to explore a wider range of possible tokens. (6) n - the number of responses to generate for a given prompt. Generating multiple responses can provide more diverse and potentially more useful output, but it also increases the cost of the request. (7) stop - a list of strings that, when encountered in the generated text, will cause the generation to stop. This can be used to control the length or the validity of the output. (8) presence penalty and frequency penalty - values that control the relative im- portance of the presence and frequency of certain words or phrases in the generated text. These hyperparameters can be useful for controlling the focus and balance of the generated text. (9) best of - the number of responses to generate server-side when selecting the ”best” (the one with the highest log probability per token) response for a given prompt. The Joint Impact of Multiple Hyperparameters It can be seen that the cost and utility of text generation are in- tertwined with the joint effect of these hyperparameters. There are also complex interactions among subsets of the hyperparameters. For example, the temperature and top p are not recommended to be altered from their default values together because they both control the randomness of theCost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference generated text, and changing both at the same time can result in conflicting effects (ope, 2023); n and best of are rarely tuned together because if the application can process multi- ple outputs, filtering on the server side causes unnecessary information loss; both n and max tokens will affect the total number of tokens generated, which in turn will affect the cost of the request. These interactions and trade-offs make it difficult to manually determine the optimal hyperparameter settings for a given text generation task. 3. EcoOptiGen We first introduce the following notations and definitions for EcoOptiGen: Tuning Data D, a small set of examples which can be used to measure the goodness of each hyperparameter configu- ration. Each data example contains a few text fields. For example, the HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) dataset con- tains an input field which is the concatenation of the Python function signature and the doc string, and a test field of the test code. Utility Function U, a function that represents the utility (a real-valued score) of the generated text. For example, for code generation, the utility is the success rate of passing the test; for text summarization, the utility is the effectiveness of summarization such as the rouge score. The utility of multiple verifiable responses (i.e., the best response can be selected from them by the application) is defined as the best utility score in all responses. Budget Constraints B= (B.i, B.o ), a tuple of two val- ues:B.iis the average inference budget per example in the tuning data DandB.ois the total optimization budget. Generally, they are measured as the dollar cost which is proportional to the number of tokens in the input'"
