       "'WMS Warehouse Management System- WMS: A warehouse management system is a set of policies and processes intended to organize the work of a warehouse or distribution center and ensure that such a facility can operate efficiently and meet its objectives. ( UI Reference ) - Storage structure design: A well-executed and optimized warehouse layout design can provide easy access to stored goods, minimize travel time, and improve order fulfillment rates. It is important to consider the storage type before the design. So, it will help to execute the process in less time. ( Reference ) - Storage Type: A storage type is a storage area, warehouse facility , or a warehouse zone that you define in Warehouse Management (WM) for a warehouse number . This is a physical or logical subdivision of a warehouse complex that is characterized by its warehouse technique, the space used, its organizational form, or its function. It could be in different types such as High Rack Storage Area, Bulk Storage Area, GR Area, GI Area, etc . - Storage Capacity: Warehouse capacity refers to the amount of available space for storage, inventory preparation, and order fulfillment. To fully understand warehouse capacity, it’s important to make a clear distinction between theoretical storage capacity and working capacity. - Storage Management: Storage management is the material flow control, and forms the heart of a warehouse or distribution center. The software will coordinate the storage and retrieval as well as the transfer to or from the smallest spatial unit (storage location) of a warehouse to manage all flow from the single panel and can assign the task or control the process at the fingertip. And this panel will be perfectly capable to show details like and so on in one place: ○ Inventory tracking ○ Picking and packing. ○ Receiving and stowing. ○ Shipping. ○ Reporting. ○ Enable logistical growth. ○ Packages are processed and shipped faster. ○ Better storage allocation. UI Reference: -↓Credit: Dribble DRIBBLE DRIBBLE DRIBBLE DRIBBLE Mobile Application The Mobile application will be helpful in the making WMS process easier and faster with its mobility. ( UI References ) Mobile The Mobile application will have two modules: 1. Picking Module: In this module, the user will have the access to pick the item from the located area in the warehouse using barcode and location labeling. 2. Putting Module: This module will allow the user to put items in the warehouse after receiving a pass token from the administrator. The token will ensure that only the valid entry is allowed to proceed operation. Features: 1. Barcode scanning 2. Location tracing 3. Item entry or exit management 4. User authentication'"
